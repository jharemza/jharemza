# Hi, Iâ€™m Jeremiah Haremza ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data professional specializing in backend automation, API integration, and database-driven solutions.  
I build tools that connect, analyze, and automate systems â€” often with Python, SQL, and Postgres.  

I'm equally fluent in explaining technical decisions to non-technical stakeholders.

My projects emphasize reliability, modularity, and real-world application.

ðŸ”§ See my pinned projects below for examples of my work.
