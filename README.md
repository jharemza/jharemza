# Hi, I‚Äôm Jeremiah Haremza üëã

I'm a data professional specializing in backend automation, API integration, and database-driven solutions.  
I build tools that connect, analyze, and automate systems ‚Äî often with Python, SQL, and Postgres.  

I'm equally fluent in explaining technical decisions to non-technical stakeholders.

My projects emphasize reliability, modularity, and real-world application.

üîß See my projects below for examples of my work.
